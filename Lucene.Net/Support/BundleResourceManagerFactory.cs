    /// This implementation of <see cref="IResourceManagerFactory"/> uses a convention
    /// to retrieve resources. In Java NLS, the convention is to use the same name for the
    /// resource key propeties and for the resource file names. This presents a problem
    /// for .NET because the resource generator already creates an internal class with the
    /// same name as the <c>.resx</c> file.

    /// To work around this, we use the convention of appending the suffix "Bundle" to 
    /// the end of the type the resource key propeties are stored in. For example,
    /// if our constants are stored in a class named ErrorMessages, the type
    /// that will be looked up by this factory will be ErrorMessagesBundle (which is the
    /// name of the <c>.resx</c> file that should be added to your project).

 For an introduction to Lucene's analysis API, see the [](xref:Lucene.Net.Analysis) package documentation. 

 This module contains concrete components ([](xref:Lucene.Net.Analysis.CharFilter)s, [](xref:Lucene.Net.Analysis.Tokenizer)s, and ([](xref:Lucene.Net.Analysis.TokenFilter)s) for analyzing different types of content. It also provides a number of [](xref:Lucene.Net.Analysis.Analyzer)s for different languages that you can use to get started quickly.
